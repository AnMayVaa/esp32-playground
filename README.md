## üìñ About This Repository

Welcome to my personal playground for embedded systems! This repository serves as a living document of my learning journey with the **ESP32 microcontroller** and **MicroPython**. Here, you'll find a collection of hands-on projects, each designed to explore a specific piece of hardware, a programming concept, or a real-world application.

The goal is to move from fundamental concepts like hardware drivers to more complex integrations involving sensors and connectivity. Each project is self-contained and includes the necessary code and wiring instructions to be reproduced.

## üõ†Ô∏è General Setup & Requirements

To run any of the projects in this repository, you will generally need the following:

1.  **Hardware**: An ESP32 development board and the specific components listed in each project's README.
2.  **Firmware**: The latest stable version of [MicroPython for ESP32](https://micropython.org/download/esp32/).
3.  **IDE**: [Thonny IDE](https://thonny.org/) is highly recommended as it has excellent built-in support for MicroPython on the ESP32.

## üå± Future Goals

This repository is an ongoing project. I plan to explore more advanced topics in the future, such as:
-   [ ] Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity
-   [ ] Communicating with web services and APIs
-   [ ] Using protocols like MQTT for IoT
-   [ ] Interfacing with I2C sensors (e.g., temperature, humidity)
-   [ ] Exploring sleep modes for battery-powered projects

## üëã Contact & Acknowledgements
